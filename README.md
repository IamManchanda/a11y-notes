## What is Accessibility?

Even though we center our discussion of accessibility on users with impairments, we can all relate to the experience of using it to interface, which is not accessible to us. Have you ever tried to use a desktop optimized site on a mobile device, or seen this content is not available in your country when you are trying to watch a video online? So in a broad sense you've almost certainly experienced being unable to access something. 

As we mentioned, this cause is largely concerned with accessibility in the narrowest sense of ensuring users with disabilities can access content. However, addressing accessibility issues in the narrow sense very often improves the user experience for everyone. While we want to address accessibility first and foremost to avoid excluding people from accessing things, it certainly isn't a zero sum game. We're more likely to make things better for everyone by addressing accessibility.

## Understanding the Diversity of users!

Modern web technologies make it very easy for a developer to create a website that's difficult for someone who is blind to use. If a user has no vision, it's quite likely they would be using a screen reader, which is a software that allows them to hear the information displayed on the screen via a text to speech synthesizer. They may also be using Braille which allows them to feel the on-screen text with their fingers when using braille display. 

Many websites are visual in their nature and lack keyboard navigation which is essential for blind people to be able to navigate through the content. In general, it is safe to assume that there are more people with visual impairments, that is people who have some sight, as opposed to people who are completely blind. There are also people with low visual acuity and they may be using large print text or magnification when using the computer and I haven't mentioned people with poor color vision who may have difficulty distinguishing red and green or blue and yellow. This accounts for 9% of male and 1% of female. 

We may also find ourselves with temporary challenges, such as when trying to use a computer in the sun or looking at a dodgy projector. Whenever accessibility comes up in a conversation, people tend to picture someone who is blind. But there are actually more impairments to think about and consider. There is a huge number of people with motor or dexterity impairments. Such users may be using only the keyboard, head or eye tracking software, switches, voice dictation etc. Someone may have a broken wrist, broken track pad, or simply riding the Shaker train. 

By catering to users with permanent dexterity impairments, we ensure a great experience for everyone. There are also users with hearing impairments. For example, some may be completely deaf, yet others have some hearing. The content that uses sound should provide some kind of visual alternative. For example, a messenger app could be using a flashing alert as well as sound notifications. 

There are also users with cognitive impairments, for example ADD, dyslexia or autism. These users may require diverse accommodations, such as zooming the screen to make it easier to read the content, or minimal design to minimize destruction and cognitive load. We can all probably relate to feeling stressful or cognitive load. 

So improving the experience for users with cognitive impairments makes it so much better experience for everybody else. In summary, accessibility is really about making sure that the content and the websites we create is usable to people with various impairments or abilities.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG)

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, or WCAG is a set of guidelines and best practices which have been put together by accessibility experts to try and answer the question of what accessibility means in a methodical way. Several countries actually mandate the use of these guidelines in their web accessibility legal requirements. WCAG is organized around four core principles. 

- **Perceivable**: This is for making sure users can perceive content. This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it. 

- **Operable**: Is it operable can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example something which requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or is using a touchscreen. 

- **Understandable**: Can users understand the content? Also, can all users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion? 

- **Robust**: Is it robust enough for the content to be consumed by a wide variety of user agents? And does it work with assistive technology? 

Together this forms **POUR**. While WCAG provides an extremely comprehensive set of guidelines to help us keep many facets of accessibility in mind, it can also be a bit overwhelming. To help mitigate this, the Web aim group has distilled the WCAG guidelines down into an easy to follow checklist, targeted specifically for web content. The webbing checklist can give you a short high level summary of what you need to implement while also linking to the underlying or tag specifications if you need an expanded definition. 

Both WCAG and the checklist cover a lot of the accessibility space. The guidelines can only ever be a limited proxy for actual accessibility what actually matters is the user experience. So while these guidelines give us a framework for thinking about accessibility, there may be places where they're incomplete or even give advice which is a little out of date. 

However, they're still an excellent resource for helping us integrate accessibility into our process. With these tools in hand we can chart a direction for our accessibility work, be confident that so long as our project is meeting the outlined criteria, our users should have a positive experience.
